To find out the type of a value or a variable that refers to that value, you can use the type() function. 
Suppose you've defined a variable a, but you forgot the type of this variable. To determine the type of a, simply execute:

type(a)

We already went ahead and created three variables: a, b and c. You can use the IPython shell to discover their type. Which of the following options is correct?

1. a is of type int, b is of type str, c is of type bool
2. a is of type float, b is of type bool, c is of type str
3. a is of type float, b is of type str, c is of type bool
4. a is of type int, b is of type bool, c is of type str

Answer: 3. a is of type float, b is of type str, c is of type bool

Use the code:
  type(a)
  type(b)
  type(c)
